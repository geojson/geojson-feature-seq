# Security Considerations

GeoJSON text sequences have no security considerations beyond those of JSON
text sequences and the GeoJSON format.

TODO: discuss on the list whether the above is strictly true.

# Interoperability Considerations

While heterogeneous sequences are permitted, homogeneous sequences are more
interoperable.

TODO: back this up.
